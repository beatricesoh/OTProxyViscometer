# OTProxyViscometer

Supplementary Files for our publication "Opentrons for Automated and High-Throughput Viscometry"

OTProxyViscometer.ipynb is the notebook that contains the regression model for Newtonian liquids and analytical model presented in the paper. The .csv files in "MassProfile_Total" contain the raw experimental data (Newtonian standards) and are labeled as "MassProfile_<viscosity>_<dispenseflowrate>". The .csv files labeled "Experimental data for comparison" contain the experimental data used for comparison to the analytical model (Newtonian standards at dispense flowrate = 80 $\mu$L/s and molasses).
